# Ant Colony Optimization for the Travelling Salesman problem

## Objective
This program implements the [Ant Colony System Optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_colony_optimization_algorithms#Ant_colony_system_(ACS).

Since this was the final assignment for the Object Oriented Programming course of DEEC- Instituto Superior Técnico, this implementation follows the 4 principles of OOP, so every package is encapsulated and interact with others through the use of interfaces. You can also spot inheritance, abstraction and some cases of polymorphism.
